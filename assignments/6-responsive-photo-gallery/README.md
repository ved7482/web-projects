# Assignment 6: Responsive Photo Gallery with CSS Grid

## üì± Overview
Build a responsive product showcase webpage using HTML and CSS Grid that adapts to different screen sizes, following a mobile-first approach.

## üéØ Objectives
- Create a responsive product grid layout
- Implement mobile-first design principles
- Use media queries for device breakpoints
- Apply relative units for flexible sizing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Mobile-First Approach
- Style for phones first, then use media queries for larger screens
- Ensure the layout is optimized for small screens before expanding

### CSS Grid Implementation
- Use `grid-template-columns` with `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(..., 1fr))` for responsive columns
- Create a flexible grid that automatically adjusts based on viewport size

### Media Queries
- Implement breakpoints for tablets (768px+) and desktops (1024px+)
- Adjust `grid-template-columns` properties within media queries

### Relative Units
- Use relative units (%, rem, em, vh, vw) instead of fixed pixels
- Ensure text and elements scale proportionally with screen size

### Testing Requirements
- Use browser developer tools (device toolbar) to test responsive behavior
- Verify layout adapts correctly to different screen dimensions
<!-- 
## üñºÔ∏è Expected Results
- Desktop: 3-4 product columns
- Tablet: 2-3 product columns
- Mobile: Single column, vertically stacked -->
